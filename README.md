**Credit Risk Modelling â€“ Project Description**
The Credit Risk Modelling project focuses on building a machine learning classification system to predict whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan based on their financial, demographic, and credit-related information.
This project simulates a real-world banking and finance scenario where accurate credit risk assessment is essential for minimizing losses and improving loan approval strategies.

**Key aspects include:**

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming raw loan application data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

**Feature Selection:** Applying Chi-Square, ANOVA, and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to identify significant predictors and reduce multicollinearity.

**Model Building:** Training and comparing multiple classification algorithms including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

**Model Evaluation:** Assessing performance with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized model performance using GridSearchCV to select the best parameters for XGBoost.

**Outcome:** A high-performing credit risk prediction model that helps financial institutions identify risky borrowers and make better lending decisions.
